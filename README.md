# Impact of carbon market on production emissions
This repository contains the solution to the optimal control problem for the research paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03665
The code solves the control problem in three different cases. Each case is implemented in a different folder. For more information, see the reseach paper.
The numerical scheme is solving the HJB equation using Clark-Nicholson scheme. The boundary conditions on the computational window is chosen to accomodate the degeneracy of one of the variables.
